''' What we learned ?'''

""" Python data types: strings, integers, & floats"""
"""String is a textual data surrounded by quotes."""
"""Integers & floats are numeric data."""
"""Variables allow us to store data to use them later."""
"""Good variable naming conventions. E.g:-->> C instead of city , F instead of Food  """
