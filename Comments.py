'''What we learn'''
'''Comments are hints that we can add to our program to make the code easier to understand'''
'''In python, comments start with the # symbol.'''
'''Comments can also be used for debugging code.'''
'''Python doesn't have multiline comments.
   however , we can use multiline strings to ack like multiline comments '''
